### March 12th 2024 - Day 2 of 100

**Today's Progress**: Familiarised with vercel for hosting past projects 
    and did some studying on Arduino 

**Thought's**: It was a bit challenging to host fullstack applications on Vercel
I am yet to successfully deploy my projects. On Arduino I am familiarising myself with the environment
and gathering resources for further learning.
